# WHAT ARE FUNCTIONS ? 

**Mathematical Notation:**
f( x, y, z) = 2x + 2y - z;

**Computer Notation:**

f = (x, y, z) => 2*x + 2y -z;

functionName ( arguments x, argument y, argument z ){
		parameter x; 
}

> **Note:**
> Arguments which in the brackets are known as arguments as soon as they
> are used within the function they are known as parameters.

## Command vs Procedure vs Operation vs Method:
(A.k.a Paradigm of programming)

**Operation:**

An operation is a procedure or a function that necessarily say how to
use it. For example: You and Your dog can go for walks but the methods
used by both of you are going to be different i.e you walking one by one
foot at a time and your dog using 2 legs at a time. So basically both
you have to do same operation known as `walk()` but how both of you walk
can be completely different.

**Procedure:**

Procedures are like algorithms i.e like writing code for human brains.
It's like the name for an entire algorithm. Lets say I tell you add 3
numbers now you might come up with a normal code without any functions
but someone might come up with a function meaning there might be 100
ways to find that answer but whatever you do is gonna be known as
procedure. Most commands are procedures. 

Procedures are the steps designed to change or affect the things outside
box / relam or scope. 

They are function-like structure which do not have any return value. 

> Algorithms are the guts of procedures.


**Functions:**

Functions are always capsulated and they are like a black box with connections. This makes it easier to test as the contained meaning you can even create test functions which will start to automate your workflow. Functions are like get data and procedures are like list files. A function always has a return value. 

**Methods:**

The implemented methods to perform a certain kind of action. A function is known as method when it is been declared under a class.
