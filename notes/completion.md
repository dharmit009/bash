# Bash Completion ...

**Bash** completion is one of the best features of **bash**. The Autocompletion
feature is built in to **bash**. But it needs to be configured in order 
to use it. 

The only thing we care about `$COMP_LINE` for completion for more info
you can checkout `man bash`. 

**Note:**
> POSIX does not support autocompletion.
