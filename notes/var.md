# What are variables? 

Variables are just states stored inside a memory. In early days, the on
and off of the bulb used to define 0 and 1 for the memory.

Here is a funny thing you should know programming is nothing but a way
to make computer behave in certain way that you want and that way is
always is going to be natural. 

Here is an small example: 

Write this code and run it ...  

> a=1
> echo $a

**Output:**

1

Now tell me what do you think happened in this tiny little bit of time.
In this tiny bit of time you wrote the code and executed it. The took
the value converted in to binary made the necessary state changes in the
memory and stored it. After which you referenced it using command echo
which returned it's value back. This is only how much you would have
probably thought. But here is the thing you read the output through your
eyes your brain interpreted it and state of your brain memory changed too. 

Thats so amazing isn't it ?
